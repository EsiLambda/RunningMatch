# Running Match - An implementation of multithreading in C# windows form
In this repo, we have a running match between 5 runners. We can specify priorities for each one. Due to each runner's priority, the chance of winning will increase. 

## Types of priorities
We have five types of priorities:
* Highest
* Above Normal
* Normal
* Below Normal
* Lowest

## How does it work?
After specifying the priorities for each runner, by pressing the gun icon, the match will start. At the end, the number of the winner will be shown in a message box.
